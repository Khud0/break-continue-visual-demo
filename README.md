# "break;" and "continue;" statements in C#

// Files;

1. Downoad "Standalone .exe" folder if you just want to use the program demonstration;

The program shows how would "break;" or "continue;" statements change the "for" loop. 
If you're having troubles with understanding the statements above, I hope this could help.
